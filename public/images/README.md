# Image Assets Guide

This folder contains all image and photo assets for the portfolio website.

## File Structure
```
public/
└── images/
    ├── profile.jpg    <- Your professional headshot (place here)
    └── [other images]
```

## How to Add Your Photo

1. **Save your professional headshot** as `profile.jpg` in this folder
   - Recommended size: 500x500px or larger (square format)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File path: `/public/images/profile.jpg`

2. The Hero component will automatically load and display it with a circular frame and hover effects.

## Asset Organization

- **profile.jpg** - Your professional headshot for the Hero section
- Future images can be added here as needed (project screenshots, icons, etc.)

Note: Files in the `public/` folder are served statically and will be available at `/images/profile.jpg` in the browser.
